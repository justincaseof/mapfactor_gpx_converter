# Convert GPX file to MapFacotr xml format

Mapfactor Navigator is a great Navigation system working even on very old smartphones.
Unfortunately, there is no convenient way to plan routes on PC and import them into the app.

A feasible way to do so is to plan a route in the common GPX format and convert it to the file format in which Navigator stores its own routing points.

NOTE:
 * a downside to this simple XSLT conversion is the lack of "mergeability" of new routes into existing ones.
